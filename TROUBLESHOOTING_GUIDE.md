### **Step 2: Test Basic Functionality**

2. **Can you login?** Try any email/password to create account
3. **Can you see the dashboard?** Should show tabs for Patients, Overview, etc.

## 💡 **MOST LIKELY SOLUTIONS**

Based on the HMR updates I can see, try these in order:

### **Solution 1: Hard Refresh**

- This clears cache and reloads everything fresh

### **Solution 2: Clear Browser Data**
- In Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
- Select "All time" and clear everything
- Restart browser and try again

### **Solution 3: Check Authentication**
- The app requires login first
- Try creating a new account with any email/password
- Or use test credentials if available

### **Solution 4: Different Browser**
- Try opening http://localhost:8081 in a different browser
- This helps identify browser-specific issues

## 🚨 **SPECIFIC ERROR MESSAGES**

If you see any of these errors, here's how to fix them:

### **"Network Error" or "Failed to fetch"**
- The dev server might have stopped
- Check if you see the Vite server running in terminal
